# Saving Targets

Saving targets help children work toward financial goals with visual progress tracking.

## Creating a Target

1. Go to a child's settings (gear icon on their profile)
2. In the **Saving Targets** section, click **Add Target**
3. Enter the target name (e.g., "New Bike", "Video Game")
4. Enter the target amount
5. Click **Add**

## How Progress is Calculated

The progress bar shows what percentage of the child's **current balance** would cover the target amount.

For example:
- Target: $50 for a video game
- Current balance: $25
- Progress: 50%

!!! note
    Progress is based on total balance, not money set aside specifically for that target. A child saving for multiple things will see progress on all targets as their balance grows.

## Editing a Target

1. Go to child settings
2. Find the target in the list
3. Click the edit icon (pencil)
4. Update the name or amount
5. Click **Save**

## Deleting a Target

1. Go to child settings
2. Find the target in the list
3. Click the delete icon (trash)
4. The target is removed immediately

## Tips for Parents

- **Start small** - Begin with achievable targets to build the saving habit
- **Be specific** - "New Lego Set" is more motivating than "Toys"
- **Celebrate success** - When a target is reached, acknowledge the achievement
- **Multiple targets** - Having 2-3 targets gives children choices about what to save for
